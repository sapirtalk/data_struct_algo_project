# mevne_Code

This is one of my Data Structures and Algorithms projects i have been working on with my partner ,
it includes implementation of data structures from scratch including binary tree, Linked list, Directed graphs. 
Furthermore , it includes use of DFS, BFS , pre order print, inorder print of tree algorithms.

there are some things now i would do differently and more organized but im still happy with the result, it was a fun project and further enhanced my JAVA coding skills!


the code is documented, and ill be happy to aswer any questions about it.
